|      Software which is a modified version of one of the listed types is     |
|   not considered a new program in its own right, but is places under the    |
|   category of the program which spawned it.   Some ACOS programs, such as   |
|   Apple*Link/Frameworks or KauCom, are written entirely from scratch in     |
|   ACOS, but in general they are the exception.  Many excellent systems have |
|   been built from a GBBS or Pro-Net shell, but I do not consider them "new" |
|   software.                                                                 |

|       Those of you who have been reading the List for more than a month or  |
|   so will notice that the "megs" statistic has been removed.  There are a   |
|   number of reasons for it's exclusion in this and future editions of the   |
|   List.  For starters, many systems have been running systems on a large    |
|   capacity drive (supposedly), but have only 20 or 30 megs accessible for   |
|   the transfer section.  Secondly, it is quite difficult to call each board |
|   and calculate the total storage they have, rather than taking the sysop's |
|   word for it, and thirdly, "megs don't matter" anymore.  My personal       |
|   opinion is that a good GS system can operate on 20 megs, and its optimum  |
|   size would be about 30 to 40 megs.  Systems with more than that are, in   |
|   my opinion, wasting thier drive space on the board, unless they want to   |
|   have a huge archives system, which no one ever downloads from.  I have    |
|   been running my system on 80 megs for a year now, and now know that I     |
|   should have invested in a smaller drive and saved my money.               |
|                                                                             |

|                                                                             |
|          This will probably be the last issue of the List for some time to  |
|   come.  It's purpose has been served - to supply HST owners with a list of |
|   systems they could call back in the days when there were but a handful    |
|   of 9600 systems out there.  The popularity of the HST has expanded to a   |
|   massive degree, and there are 9600 boards to be found everywhere.  The    |
|   utter volume of new systems going up and my own time restrictions have    |
|   made it impossible to continue to publish a fully complete list every     |
|   month, even with the invaluable help that Brass Lantern, Lucky, and       |
|   Morgan Davis have given me in researching systems for the List.  It's     |
|   been fun, but all good things must come to an end eventually.             |
|          A final, completely verified List will be published next month.    |
|                                                                  The Byter  |

|          I would like to thank all of those sysops who have displayed this  |
|   list in their BBS systems, and who have made it the most widely-used Apple|
|   BBS list in use these days.  Other sysops are encouraged to incorporate   |
|   the List into their systems as well, so long as the contents remain       |
|   unaltered.                                                                |
